- Follow the instructions to install the component.
- You may need to restart your computer for environment variable changes
  to take effect before using the component.

The component can be launched by double-clicking the
``IkSolvers_SeedWaistLeftArmComp`` executable. The ``IkSolvers_SeedWaistLeftArm`` library
is available for loading into a manager, using the initialisation function
``IkSolvers_SeedWaistLeftArmInit``.

system:

- Download the source, either from the repository or a source archive,
  and extract it somewhere::

    tar -xvzf IkSolvers_SeedWaistLeftArm-1.0.0.tar.gz

- Change to the directory containing the extracted source::

    cd IkSolvers_SeedWaistLeftArm-1.0.0

- Create a directory called ``build``::

    mkdir build

- Change to that directory::

    cd build

- Run cmake or cmake-gui::

    cmake ../

- If no errors occurred, run make::
